## About Chess    
Chess is a strategical two player board game played on a 8x8 checkered board     
where a player tries to capture opponent's king while protecting his own with the     
help of 16 pieces and 6 types each of which has a unique set of possible moves.    

## How to Run    
1. Download the repository as zip and extract it.

## How Engine works    

### General     
Engine keeps track of the turn and if that player selects a piece, all the valid     
moves of that piece are highlighted and if square is selected among those,     
the move is played and turn switches to other player. Game ends when the     
player in turn has no valid moves left.    

### How Check is detected    
All the moves of opponent's pieces are generated and if any of the piece     
is attacking the king, the current player is in check.    

### How valid moves are decided
All possible moves of selected piece are generated.     
- If the king is in check and a move doesn't prevent it, it is not valid.     
- If the king is not in check, but a move causes check, it is not valid.     

### How Computer mode works    
Player is given option to choose it's preferred color.    
After player has made the move, computer generates a move for it's color.     
The move is played and waits for next player move.    
<br/>

There are several versions which have differnet ways of generating moves:    
1. **Random Move Generator**: All the pieces are iterated one by one if the piece    
has any valid move. A random number is generated. If the number is greater    
than the threshold, that piece is selected to make the move and a random move    
among the valid moves is made.    
2. **Greedy Move Generator**: The move which results in capturing highest scored     
piece from opponent immediately is selected. If no move results in capturing,     
a random move is selected.     
3. **Minimax Algorithm**: Minimax is extended version of greedy algorithm where    
instead for each move of one player all moves of opponent are generated and so     
on and best score among all cases is selected. This algorithm is based on    
backtracking.    

### Theory of Minimax Algorithm    
**Assumptions**     
We will take a state of board and calculate the score of current position.    
Let's assume that a positive score is favorable for white and negative    
score favors black. So, a white player will try to move pieces in a way    
which allows him to increase the score of board. For now, we assume we have    
a function to calculate the score from board.    
<br/>

**Min Max Tree**    
We consider the state of board generated by each move as a child node of    
previous state of board. After one move, the turn switches so next layer    
will consider all opponents moves and so on. Once we reach desired depth    
we calculate the score of all the leaf node boards.    

We assume that both players play optimally. If the turn at leaf node is    
white's, we will take the maximum of all child nodes and assign it to    
parent nodes as white is trying to maximise the score. Among all the parent    
nodes, we take the minimum and assign it to their parents because turn    
switches and black tries to minimise the score. The final score of root node    
is the best score the player can get from current state of board and the    
move is made to achieve that score.    

An example of simple game tree:

**Efficiency of algorithm**    
The maximum number of moves a piece has is 32(Queen on centre) and other    
pieces have 3-16 moves. So the number of leaf nodes increase exponentially    
as we try to increase the number of layers. For a depth of 2, on average    
there are 4000 leaf nodes and for depth 3, there are 25000 leaf nodes and    
calculating the score will require some calculations and doing that for    
each leaf node is inefficient, so it's not feasible to go beyond 3 layers    
without any optimizations.    

**Alpha beta pruning**    
In alpha beta pruning, we avoid searching the branches that will not yield    
the optimal score in any case.    

![pruning](rmImages/abprune.png)     
In this tree, consider the rightmost subtree. The score of one subtree is 5.    
We already have a score of 6 from middle subtree which is greater than 5.    
If the rest of subtree in rightmost branch gives a score of greater than 5,    
it will not be considered as this is opponent's turn and it will minimize the    
score. If it is less than 6, then also it will not be considered as it is    
not optimal. So we don't need to calculate the tree at all which decreases the    
number of leaves evaluated.      

Observed efficiency after using alpha beta pruning, for a depth of 2, only    
500 leaf nodes are evaluated and for depth of 3, 5000 leaf nodes are evaluated    
which is a significant improvement. The number of nodes evaluated depends on    
the evaluation of score. With a better evaluation function, we can further     
reduce the nodes evaluated by a great amount.    

**Evaluation function**    
Each piece has a base score associated with it. In a game of chess, pawn is    
worth 1 point, bishop and knight are worth 3 points, rook is worth 5 point and    
queen is worth 9 points. We can assign scores to pieces similar to this basis.    

But, just the piece itself is not an appropriate measure. The position of    
piece also matters. I have added piece tables which grants bonus points if    
a certain type of piece is on a strong square, thus motivating the computer     
to make certain moves thus improving the structure. The number of valid moves    
is also considered a factor as a piece free to move is stronger than a trapped    
piece. If a piece is defending other pieces or attacking other pieces, it is    
stronger which is also taken into account.    

We can tweak the points awarded for each of these parameters and add other     
factors to make a better evaluation function.
